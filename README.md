# PYSON #

## Overview ##
The purpose of this project is to provide a python-based alternative to JSON. This is a (almost) fully functional JSON-inspired data management system!

## How to Use ##
*THIS PROJECT IS NOT YET FINISHED! DOCUMENTATION IS ONLY SHOWN FOR COMPLETED FEATURES. SOME FEATURES MAY BREAK DUE TO CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT. IF YOU SEE A PROBLEM, PLEASE LET ME KNOW!*<br>
<br>Believe it or not, this project is surprisingly easy to use. The only thing you have to do is copy/paste the contents of pyson.py into your own Python project! From then, you can just `import pyson`, and use functions as normal! Support for other languages may come soon. Support for this as a library (no copy-paste needed) may be coming soon as well.<br>
<br>***The PYSON format does NOT include a newline at the end of the file, files with a newline at the end will be considered invalid***

Output: A list of all datas in their respective types<br>

#### getWhole ####
Required inputs: `filePath`, `datacall`, `datatype`, `data`<br>
Outputs: None<br>
Modifications to .pyson:<br>
Adds a datapoint in file `filePath`, will call `datacall`, with type `datatype`, and value `data`. <br>

#### isCompatible ####
Required inputs: `filePath`<br>
Outputs: Bool<br>
Checks if a file is compatible with .cnf file format. Returns True if so, returns False if not. <br>

## Supported Types ##
There are 4 supported types: int, float, str, and list
<br><br>
An int is a whole number that can be any value<br>
A str is a list of text (quotes not required)<br>
A list is a list of values, which currently have to all be strings.<br> 

More supported types may be added. 

## Changelog ##

v0.0.4: Added a function that checks if a file is compatible with .pyson file format. Fixed a bug in the write. Other general bug fixes.<br> 
v0.0.3: Added a write function! This is now (technicaally) a fully functioning data service!<br>
v0.0.2: Added a read function for the whole file. Returns a list of all contents. This is actually getting pretty cool!<br>

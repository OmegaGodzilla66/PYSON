## Overview ##
The purpose of this project is to provide a python-based alternative to JSON. This is a (almost) fully functional JSON-inspired data management system!

## How to Use ##
**THIS PROJECT IS NOT YET FINISHED! DOCUMENTATION IS ONLY SHOWN FOR COMPLETED FEATURES. SOME FEATURES MAY BREAK DUE TO CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT. IF YOU SEE A PROBLEM, PLEASE LET ME KNOW!**
<br>Believe it or not, this project is surprisingly easy to use.<br>
<br> The only thing you have to do is `pip install pyson-data` ! From then, you can just `import pyson_data as pyson`, and use functions as normal!
Support for other languages may come soon.<br>

## quickstart ## 
TODO: write later

## documentation ##
Documentation has been moved to the project wiki [here](https://github.com/OmegaGodzilla66/PYSON/wiki) to decrease clutter in the README.

## Supported Types ##
There are 4 supported types: int, float, str, and list
<br><br>
- An int is a whole number that can be any value<br>
- A str is a list of text (quotes not required)<br>
- A list is a list of values, which currently have to all be strings. List items are seperated by the (*) seperator.
Currently there is no escaping support. I don't really know why you would use that value normally in a list. <br> 
- A float is a decimal number, that can be any value<br>

More supported types may be added.

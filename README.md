## Overview ##
The purpose of this project is to provide a python-based alternative to JSON. This is a (almost) fully functional JSON-inspired data management system!

## How to Use ##
This is a pip package, so to use this in python you can just `pip install pyson-data`.
From there, you can just `import pyson_data as pyson`.
Support for other languages may come soon.<br>

## Quickstart ##
Refer to the project wiki [here](https://github.com/OmegaGodzilla66/PYSON/wiki)

## Documentation ##
Documentation has also been moved to the project wiki [here](https://github.com/OmegaGodzilla66/PYSON/wiki) to decrease clutter in the README.

## Supported Types ##
There are 4 supported types: int, float, str, and list
<br><br>
- An int is a whole number that can be any valu
- A str is a list of text (quotes not required)
- A list is a list of values, which currently have to all be strings. List items are seperated by the (*) seperator.
Currently there is no escaping support. I don't really know why you would use that value normally in a list.
- A float is a decimal number, that can be any value representable by a 64-bit floating point number.
<br>More supported types may be added  at some point in the future.
